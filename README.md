# Rule-Based Chatbot

This repository contains a simple, rule-based chatbot developed as part of the Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha. The chatbot is designed to interact with users through basic conversational input and return predefined responses.

## Project Objective

To build a simple Python chatbot that can simulate a basic conversation by recognizing specific input phrases and responding with fixed outputs.

## Features

- Accepts user input from the console
